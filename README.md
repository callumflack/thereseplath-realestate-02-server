# Therese Plath Real Estate website listings server

This node.js server recieves listings XML, converts them to JSON and pushes the resulting JSON to the [_data directory here](https://github.com/callumflack/thereseplath-realestate-02/tree/master/_data).

It ran on a Digital Ocean droplet for about 3 years. 

Turned off on 2019.07.26.
